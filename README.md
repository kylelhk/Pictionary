## Purpose

**Draw, guess, and chill with friends in a game of wits and sketches!**

- One player draws a word or phrase while others guess what it is.
- Enjoy fun, creativity, and laughter in this engaging Pictionary-like experience.
- Perfect for parties or casual hangouts!

## Architecture

### Client-Side (Frontend):

- **HTML**: The markup language used to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links on a web page.
- **CSS**: The style sheet language used for describing the presentation of the web pages, including colors, layout, and
  fonts.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers, including the use of
  two JavaScript libraries:
  - **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: A set of web development techniques that allows a web page to
    communicate with a server asynchronously, without reloading the page.
  - **jQuery**: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies things like HTML document traversal
    and manipulation, event handling, and animation.
- **Bootstrap**: An open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing design templates and
  themes for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

### Server-Side (Backend):

- **Flask**: A micro web framework written in Python. It's used to handle requests and responses, interact with the
  database, and render templates into HTML to be sent to the client.

### Database:

- **SQLite**: A compact and reliable SQL database engine that offers a self-contained, serverless, and
  zero-configuration database system. It's embedded directly into the application, providing robust data storage
  capabilities.

- **Test database**: A small database `app.db` was set up for testing purpose. Usernames can be found in the User model and all passwords were set as "Test5505".

## Launch

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kylelhk/Pictionary
```

2. Setup virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Create a `.flaskenv` environment file to setup environment variables.
   (Save the file in the same location as `.flaskenv.example`). Copy the content of `.flaskenv.example` to `.flaskenv`.

4. Download and install the required packages by running the following command

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

5. Initialise the database

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

Run this command to add words to draw and guess to the app's database

```bash
flask load-data
```

6. Run the app

```bash
flask run
```

Enjoy!

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the `test/unit/` directory.

### Setup

Before running the tests, ensure your `.flaskenv` file contains the following value for the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:

```bash
FLASK_APP="app:create_app('TestConfig')"
```

### Running tests

To run all tests, use the following command:

```py
python -m unittest
```

For a more detailed output:

```py
python -m unittest -v
```

To run a specific test class file, use the command:

```py
python -m unittest test.unit.<filename without .py extension>
```

## System Tests

System tests are located in the `test/system/` directory.

### Setup:

1. Download ChromeDriver, ensuring that you download the version that matches your installed Chrome version.
2. Set Chrome and ChromeDriver paths:
   - Change the path to Chrome and ChromeDriver in `test/system/test_selenium.py` to match your environment.
3. Ensure the `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set to the test configuration, as described in the unit tests above.
4. Ensure the Flask application is running by running the command, `flask run`.

### Running tests

To run the system test, use the following command:

```py
python -m unittest test.system.test_selenium
```
